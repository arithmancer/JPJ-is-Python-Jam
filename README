JPJ is a reimplementation of FT Jam in Python 3. FT Jam can be found here:

FT Jam itself an "enhanced" version of Perforce Jam which can be found here:

This license also applies to JPJ.

JPJ is a reimplementation rather than a port so the only file in common with
the earlier versions is Jambase (the description of the default rules in the Jam
scripting language). However, the source of FT Jam was used as a reference for
writing JPJ, in particular path.py.

JPJ is currently in a pre-alpha state, known issues include:

* No installer
* The -j option is not yet implemented
* The numbered -d debug options are not implemented
* Actions building multiple targets will be run more than once
